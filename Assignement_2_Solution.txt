1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Solution :
The two values of different data type are :
True
False

We can write them in this way :
a=True
b=False


2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

Solution : 
AND
OR
NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

Solution :

AND:
A	B	Result
True	True	True
True	False	False
False	True	False
False	False	False

OR:
A	B	Result
True	True	True
True	False	True
False	True	True
False	False	False

NOT:
A	Result	
True	False	
False	True


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Solution :
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) -> False
not (5 > 4) -> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) -> False
(True and True) and (True == False) -> False
(not False) or (not True) -> True


5. What are the six comparison operators?

Solution :
Greater than >
Less than <
Equal ==
Less than or equal to <=
Greater than or equal to >=
Not equal !=


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

Solution :

Equal to operator (==):
It is an equality relational operator that evaluates two expression and the compare the result if they are 
equal then it'll return true otherwise it'll return false.

Assignment operator (=) : 
It is just to assign the value to the variable.


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Solution :

spam = 0
if spam == 10:		                   
	print('eggs')		##I Block				
	if spam > 5:		
		print('bacon')	##II Block
	else:			
		print('ham')	##III Block
	print('spam')
print('spam')



8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

Solution :
spam=int(input("Enter spam value "))
if(spam==1):
    print('Hello')
if(spam==2):
    print("Howdy")
if(spam!=1 and spam!=2):
    print("Greetings!")




9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

Solution :
CTRL + C



10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

Solution :
break statement terminates the loop in which the current statements is present.
continue statement skips a single iteration in a loop and the instruction will move to one iteration up in the loop. 



11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Solution :
So, Basically there is no difference between the output result of all the three statements.
All three will execute in the same way, the only difference in their Syntax structure.
range(10) : 
This will run 10 times and it'll take by default initial value as 0 and step value as 1 as these two values are not provided.
 
range(0, 10) :
This will run 10 times and it'll take initial value as 0 and step values as 1 as it's not provided.

range(0, 10, 1):
This will run 10 times and it'll take initial value as 0 and step values as 1 as all the three valuea are provided.




12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Solution :
Program using For Loop:

for i in range(10):
    print(i+1)

Program using While Loop:

i=0
while(i<10):
    print(i+1)
    i=i+1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

Solution :
First we need to import the module :
import spam

Then we can call this function using :
spam.bacon()
